To file an A-to-z Guarantee, visit [Request an A-to-z Guarantee Refund](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?&nodeId=GSZAYH7K2C2NVNC9)\\n\\nPackaging Your Return\\n---------------------\\n\\nWhen you return your item, use the packaging that your order arrived in or packaging with similar dimensions. Avoid using over-sized boxes or packaging. If the product required assembly, disassemble the item first.\\n\\nPostage and Delivery Confirmation\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nIf you are sending the item within the United States and the order is valued at $100 or more, insure the shipment for the value of the merchandise and ship your return with a signature shipping service. Items valued over $35 must be returned to the seller with a trackable shipping service. For items below $35, we suggest USPS delivery confirmation service. If a package doesn't arrive and you don't use a trackable method to return or if you refuse the shipment as a method of return, we may not be able to cover you under the A-to-z Guarantee.\\n\\n**Extra Large or Heavy Items:** For most extra large or heavy item returns, you will be provided with a postage due label or the seller will provide you with prepaid label. In cases where you are provided with a postage due label, you are responsible for the return shipping fee. Packages are defined as extra large or heavy when one or more of the following is true:\\n\\n*   The package weighs more than 90 lbs.\\n*   The package exceeds 96 inches in length\\n*   The package exceeds a total of 130 inches in length and girth \\\\[(2 x width) + (2 x height)\\\\]\\n\",\n",

If the product type isn\\'t listed or doesn\\'t state another returns time frame, our standard 30-day return policy applies.\\n*   While most sellers offer a returns policy equivalent to Amazon\\'s, some seller returns policies may vary. If the seller\\'s listing is eligible for Amazon Prime, it will be subject to the same return policies as items fulfilled by Amazon.com that are outlined on this page. For more information about returning to third-party sellers, see [Returns to Third-Party Sellers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G38BHJQ25PNCLUBU).\\n*   For products purchased from the Amazon Global Store, see [Amazon Global Store Returns](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GTC6YZ53UWRCJV4P).\\n*   For more information on refund timing and amounts (including partial refunds and restocking fees), see [Refunds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=GKQNFKFK5CF3C54B).\\n*   If you have returned an item to Amazon by mistake or included something not intended for Amazon in a return, see [Mistaken Returns](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GR2FSVKC9XJRFDRN).\\n*   If you have already received a refund and are expected to return the item, you can create a return request. For more information about how to create a returns request see [Return Items You Ordered](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G6E3B2E8QPHQ88KF). You will be charged if an item that is expected to be returned is not sent back to us.\\n*   If the item has already been sent back to us and you have received an email asking you return it or have been charged for item, we will reverse the charge as soon as the return is processed by us. It might take additional time for your financial institution to make funds available in your account.\\n\\nAmazon Alexa Voice Shopping\\n---------------------------\\n\\nNon-digital products purchased using Alexa are eligible for free returns, except for Amazon Pharmacy purchases, which are subject to Amazon Pharmacy\\'s return policy. To return a product purchased using Alexa, process your return as normal in the Returns Center. We\\'ll automatically refund you any shipping charges applied to the return.
