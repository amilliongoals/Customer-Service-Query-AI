# About Mistaken Returns to Amazon - Amazon Customer Service
Ensure you send the correct and complete item when making a return. The correct item must be returned to receive a refund.

Amazon does not store items mistakenly sent to us and instead donates, or recycles them, when appropriate and possible. If you accidentally sent the wrong item to Amazon, contact [Customer Service](https://www.amazon.com/GP/HELP/CUSTOMER/CONTACT-US) as soon as possible. We cannot guarantee your item will be found, and no compensation is provided for incorrect items sent to Amazon.
