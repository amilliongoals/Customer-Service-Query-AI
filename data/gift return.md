# Return a Gift - Amazon Customer Service
The Returns Center allows gift recipients to return items marked as a gift at the time of purchase.

**Important note:** Before starting your return process, please be aware that gift items valued at more than $2000 can only be refunded to the original payment method of the purchaser of the gift.

**Exchanges & Replacements**

If you received a gift and need an exchange or replacement, you'll need to return the gift and place a new order. If you’re the gift giver, you can request a replacement in Your Orders

How to return a gift:

**Return a Gift - With or Without Gift Receipt**

To start a gift return you will need your order number. You can find your 17-digit order number on your packing slip that came with your item. You can also find it on the digital gift receipt we emailed you. If you can't locate the order number, you can ask the gift giver for details.

**Things to Consider Before Returning a Gift**

A returned item must be in the same condition in which it was received (including accessories). This information is stated in our [return policy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=GKM69DUUYKQWKWX7). You may receive a partial refund for returned items not received in this condition. For more information, visit the [Refunds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKQNFKFK5CF3C54B) help page.

Before you return items on which you've saved personal information; laptops, cameras, or other electronic devices, erase this information completely.

To receive the correct refund, don't include items from multiple orders or shipments in the same return box.

**How to Track Your Return**

Track your return through the Return Summary email that you received after requesting your return or in the [Returns Center](https://www.amazon.com/returns) .

**How We Process Your Refund**

Gift recipients aren’t eligible for instant refunds. If you're the gift recipient, we'll process your refund as an Amazon.com Gift Card after we receive your return. The refund amount goes to the gift card balance of the Amazon account that you used to generate your return.

To view your refund status, follow the instructions on [Check the Status of Your Refund](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GMP8PC8KBY5FCPM2).

If you're the gift giver, you can receive a refund to your gift card balance or the original payment method. All refunds are subject to our refund policies and timelines outlined in [Refunds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKQNFKFK5CF3C54B).
