**If you linked your account at the time of purchase from an Amazon Style store:**

1.  Go to [Your Orders](https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/order-history), under the **Amazon Stores** section, select the order with the item you want to return.
2.  Select **Request Item Return** and follow the steps to select the item to return, the reason for return, and select the return shipping or drop-off method.
3.  Complete your return, by confirming shipping or drop-off options.

For additional support on returning an item by mail, [Contact Us](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/contact-us/) to receive a mailing label. If the item doesn't appear in [Your Orders](https://amazon.com/your-orders), you'll only be able to return the item in the store.

**Note:** If you've paid for an item with cash, return to the store where the item was purchased with your receipt.
