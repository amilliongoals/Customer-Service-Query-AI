# Returns to Third-Party Sellers - Amazon Customer Service
When you order from a seller that fulfills and ships its own inventory (also called a third-party seller), your return is sent back to the seller instead of Amazon.com.

Third-party sellers adhere to the Amazon.com policies that are outlined in [About Our Returns Policies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&nodeId=GKM69DUUYKQWKWX7).

For information about submitting a return request, see [Return Items You Ordered](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&nodeId=G6E3B2E8QPHQ88KF).

Third-party sellers must offer one of these methods for your return:

*   Provide a return address within the United States
*   A prepaid return label
*   A full refund without requesting the item be returned.

If a third-party seller does not offer these methods to return your items, you may file an A-to-z Guarantee claim. To file an A-to-z Guarantee, visit [Request an A-to-z Guarantee Refund](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?&nodeId=GSZAYH7K2C2NVNC9)

Packaging Your Return
---------------------

When you return your item, use the packaging that your order arrived in or packaging with similar dimensions. Avoid using over-sized boxes or packaging. If the product required assembly, disassemble the item first.

Postage and Delivery Confirmation
---------------------------------

If you are sending the item within the United States and the order is valued at $100 or more, insure the shipment for the value of the merchandise and ship your return with a signature shipping service. Items valued over $35 must be returned to the seller with a trackable shipping service. For items below $35, we suggest USPS delivery confirmation service. If a package doesn't arrive and you don't use a trackable method to return or if you refuse the shipment as a method of return, we may not be able to cover you under the A-to-z Guarantee.

**Extra Large or Heavy Items:** For most extra large or heavy item returns, you will be provided with a postage due label or the seller will provide you with prepaid label. In cases where you are provided with a postage due label, you are responsible for the return shipping fee. Packages are defined as extra large or heavy when one or more of the following is true:

*   The package weighs more than 90 lbs.
*   The package exceeds 96 inches in length
*   The package exceeds a total of 130 inches in length and girth \[(2 x width) + (2 x height)\]
