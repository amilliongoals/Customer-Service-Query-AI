# Return Shipping - Amazon Customer Service
You can return your package using Your Orders.

Return Shipping Costs
---------------------

When you choose the shipping method for your return, return fees are calculated. Delivery addresses in the 50 United States (U.S.) and APO/FPO addresses using a U.S. zip code are eligible for [Free Returns](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=18726306011).

If you return an item using a paid method, we'll deduct the cost of return shipping and restocking fees from your refund.

If you choose to ship the item on your own, you'll pay the carrier when you ship your return.

For more information about refunds and refund amounts, go to [Refunds and Exchanges](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKYMTZL9KZXH66N9).
